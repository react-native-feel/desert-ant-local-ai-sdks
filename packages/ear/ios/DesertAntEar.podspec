  # iOS 17 is the desert-ant-core package floor (`platforms:` in its
  # Package.swift), not Ear's own: `Sources/Ear` carries no `@available` and its
  # catalog entry declares no `osFloor`, so it inherits `OSFloor.packageFloor`
  # (iOS 16) and the artifact would load lower -- SwiftPM simply will not resolve
  # the package into a consumer below 17. Unlike Clips there is nothing to check
  # at runtime here: `ear.mlmodelc` is an ordinary Core ML program, not a
  # multifunction one, so the declared floor and the artifact's real floor agree.

  # The Swift package itself is bridged in exactly once, by DesertAntCore, and
  # this pod links against that rather than declaring its own `spm_dependency`.
  #
  # That is not tidiness. Xcode links a package product's static library *into*
  # the linking pod's archive, so a second `spm_dependency` here would give
  # `libDesertAntEar.a` its own copy of the thirteen shared desert-ant-core
  # objects the other model pods already have, and an app using two models would
  # fail to link with ~1,071 duplicate symbols. Measured; see the note in
  # packages/core/ios/DesertAntCore.podspec.
  #
  # `import Ear` below still works: DesertAntCore names `Ear` among its products,
  # and the search path added here finds the swiftmodule it built.
